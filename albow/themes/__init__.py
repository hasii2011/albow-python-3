"""
    Themes provide a centralized way of customising the appearance of Albow widgets on a per-class basis. There
    are three parts to the theme system:

    - Theme properties, which are attributes that get looked up
    automatically in the currently active themes
    - The Theme class, instances of which hold values for
    the theme properties of a particular class;
    - The theme module, which holds a default hierarchy of Theme instances that your application can replace.

    See the documentation pages on each of these for more details.
