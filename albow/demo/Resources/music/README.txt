These were originally in some advanced .wav format that pygame could not play.
I converted them to .mp3 format using ffmpeg

ffmpeg -i ElecPiK04\ 75E-04.wav new04.mp3
ffmpeg -i ElecPiK04\ 75E-03.wav new03.mp3
ffmpeg -i ElecPiK04\ 75E-02.wav new02.mp3
ffmpeg -i ElecPiK04\ 75E-01.wav new01.mp3

The Zoe Poledouris soundtrack is on several web sites on the 'Net;  Google it, Bing it, Yahoo it.  :-)
