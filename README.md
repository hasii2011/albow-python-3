[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/python3-albow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/python3-albow)

This project is a port of Gregory Ewing's Albow project (https://www.pygame.org/project/338/4687) that was only
compatible with Python 2 and is unsupported since 2014.

Ported to Python 3 and extended by [Humberto A. Sanchez II](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasii/)
Updated documentation at:  https://hasii2011.github.io

and at

https://albow-30-documentation.deelo.cloud


Install in your virtual environment with

pip3 install python3-albow


I saw recently where Gregory has albow working on Python 3.  Maybe, I should abandon this project
